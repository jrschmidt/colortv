<h5>A pixel manipulation experiment</h5>

If you grew up with old CRT screen color televisions, you may have looked at the TV screen with a magnifying glass when you were a kid. If you did, you'd have noticed that, instead of pixels as we think of them today, the screen contained an interlaced pattern of red, green and blue dots.
